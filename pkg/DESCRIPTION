Description: This package provides functions for multiple versions
	     (commonly wrongly called parameterisations) of the generalized
	     lambda distribution. Functions are provided (or will be) for the
	     density function, distribution function, quantile function and
	     for random number generation. Code has been drawn from a number
	     of existing packages and reformatted to agree with the style of
	     the packages GeneralizedHyperbolic, NormalLaplace,
	     VarianceGamma and SkewHyperbolic.
